# SLA Automation

## Context
Each month the Community Board office must generate resolutions following the Full Board meeting. In particular, the most common resolutions are for liquor license updates and must be sent to the State Liquor Authority (SLA).

The process involves data extraction from multiple files, generating new documents, creating PDF files, merging PDFs, and more.

## Description
This project seeks to automate as much of the SLA resolution creation process as possible.

## Workflow
1. Locate the Full Board meeting minutes document which contains all resolution texts
2. Locate the SLA applications on the Community Board website
3. Locate and download all stipulation documents from the Community Board website
